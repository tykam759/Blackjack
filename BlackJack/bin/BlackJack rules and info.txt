Rules of the game:
-The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.
-Face cards are worth 10. Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever makes a better hand.
-Each player starts with two cards, one of the dealer's cards is hidden until the end.
-To 'Hit' is to ask for another card. To 'Stand' is to hold your total and end your turn.
-If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand.
-If you are dealt 21 from the start (Ace & 10), you got a blackjack.
-Dealer will hit until his/her cards total 17 or higher.
-Doubling is like a hit, only the bet is doubled, and you only get one more card.
-Split can be done when you have two of the same cards - the pair is split into two hands.
-Splitting also doubles the bet because each new hand is worth the original bet.
-You can only double/split on the first move, or first move of a hand created by a split.
-You can double on a hand resulting from a split, tripling, or quadrupling you bet.
